## Daily Menu and Meal Choices

This app shows meal item choices and allows a user to search by name or category (lunch, dessert, etc)

There are 'add to menu' buttons on each item, but I have not managed to get the menu feature working yet.  

I am trying to add the items to a list and then render that list on the Today's Menu page.


This could be connected to an API and the user could make visual menus.
